%% Visits, demand and throughput
% An application running on an embedder systems, alternates between CPU, Disk, and network communication cycles. 
% Arrival rates, average service times, and routing probabilities have been determined and are shown in the picture.

% Compute:
% 1. The visits of the three stations
% 2. The demand of the three station
% 3. The throughput of the three stations

% average service times
